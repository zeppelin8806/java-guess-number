Document the bugs you found, in this format:

EX. [Class where bug was found]
[Description of bug]
[What you did to fix it and get your tests to pass]
---------------------------------------------------
1. class WordCount
The bug was not adding multiple strings to the map. Due to the wrong method being called.
On line 26, I changed containsValue with containsKey. This makes the search through the Map output look at the right thing.
---------------------------------------------------
2. class Less20
The bug was producing a logic error from how the booleans were being called out.
The "this." function was being added to the int n, which wasn't necessary and causing the boolean to fail.
---------------------------------------------------
3. class Lucky13
The bug was producing a logic error from how the index of the arrays were called out.
Within the second if statement, it compared integers at the same if they were both 1 & 3 due to an "and", instead of an "or" statement.
---------------------------------------------------
4. class FrontTimes
Results from the method were one string short from expected.
The for statements had a "-1" after the integer n, which caused the for loop statement to stop one loop short of expected.
