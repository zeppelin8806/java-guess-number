# Vacation Expense Estimator - Module 1 Sample Application

This is a command-line application intended to demonstrate everything learned in Module 1 (Intro to Programming in Java).

Launch it by running the `main` method of the `Application` class. You can then use the menus to specify various information about a planned vacation, and the application provides an estimate of the vacation's total cost. You can adjust the length of the trip or the number of travelers at any time, and the cost updates accordingly. You can save a vacation to a file and later load it back in for further modification. You can load a sample vacation from `example.xml`.

Comments at the top of each class and interface explain its purpose. The application is mostly contained in the `com.techelevator.vee` package, with the utility classes that aren't specifically related to vacations in `com.techelevator.util`.
